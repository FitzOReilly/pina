# pinch
A lightweight pinch analysis package.

## Pinch analysis
Pinch analysis is a method for minimizing the thermal energy consumption of
processes and designing efficient heat exchanger networks.

## How to use this package?
There is a Jupyter Notebook with a [`simple example`](example_simple.ipynb) and
a detailed explanation.

Some more complex examples can be found in [`examples.py`](examples.py). You can
simply run all of them from the terminal
```
python -m examples
```
or use them interactively from a python console, e.g.:
```python
import examples
examples.multiple_pinches()
```
