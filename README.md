# pinch
A lightweight pinch analysis package.

## Pinch analysis
Pinch analysis is a method for minimizing the thermal energy consumption of
processes and designing efficient heat exchanger networks.

## How to use this package?
The file [`example_simple.ipynb`](example_simple.ipynb) contains a Jupyter
Notebook with a simple example and a detailed explanation.

Some more complex examples can be found in [`examples.py`](examples.py). You can
simply run all of them from the terminal
```
python -m examples
```
or use them interactively from within python, e.g.:
```python
import examples
examples.four_stream()
```
